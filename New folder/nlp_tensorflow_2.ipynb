    "In NLP, there are two main concepts for turning text into numbers:\n",
    "* **Tokenization** - A straight mapping from word or character or sub-word to a numerical value. There are three main levels of tokenization:\n",
    "  1. Using **word-level tokenization** with the sentence \"I love TensorFlow\" might result in \"I\" being `0`, \"love\" being `1` and \"TensorFlow\" being `2`. In this case, every word in a sequence considered a single **token**.\n",
    "  2. **Character-level tokenization**\n",
    "  3. **Sub-word tokenization**\n",
    "* **Embeddings** - An embedding is a representation of natural language which can be learned. Representation comes in the form of a **feature vector**. For example, the word \"dance\" could be represented by the 5-dimensional vector `[-0.8547, 0.4559, -0.3332, 0.9877, 0.1112]`. It's important to note here, the size of the feature vector is tuneable. There are two ways to use embeddings:\n",
    "  1. **Create your own embedding** - Once your text has been turned into numbers (required for an embedding), you can put them through an embedding layer (such as [`tf.keras.layers.Embedding`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Embedding)) and an embedding representation will be learned during model training.\n",
    "  2. **Reuse a pre-learned embedding** - Many pre-trained embeddings exist online. These pre-trained embeddings have often been learned on large corpuses of text (such as all of Wikipedia) and thus have a good underlying representation of natural language. You can use a pre-trained embedding to initialize your model and fine-tune it to your own specific task.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What level of tokenzation should I use? What embedding should should I choose?\n",
    "\n",
    "It depends on your problem. You could try character-level tokenization/embeddings and word-level tokenization/embeddings and see which perform best. You might even want to try stacking them (e.g. combining the outputs of your embedding layers using [`tf.keras.layers.concatenate`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/concatenate)).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're looking for pre-trained word embeddings, [Word2vec embeddings](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-word2vec/), [GloVe embeddings](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) and many of the options available on [TensorFlow Hub](https://tfhub.dev/s?module-type=text-embedding) are great places to start.\n",

    "\n",
    "Many production systems use an **ensemble** (multiple different models combined) of models to make a prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind model stacking is that if several uncorrelated models agree on a prediction, then the prediction must be more robust than a prediction made by a singular model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The keyword in the sentence above is **uncorrelated**, which is another way of saying, different types of models. For example, in our case, we might combine our baseline, our bidirectional model and our TensorFlow Hub USE model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although these models are all trained on the same data, they all have a different way of finding patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to use three similarly trained models, such as three LSTM models, the predictions they output will likely be very similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we're working with a classification problem, there are a few of ways we can combine our models:\n",
    "1. **Averaging** - Take the output prediction probabilities of each model for each sample, combine them and then average them.\n",
    "2. **Majority vote (mode)** - Make class predictions with each of your models on all samples, the predicted class is the one in majority. For example, if three different models predict `[1, 0, 1]` respectively, the majority class is `1`, therefore, that would be the predicted label.\n",
    "3. **Model stacking** - Take the outputs of each of your chosen models and use them as inputs to another model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Resource:** The above methods for model stacking/ensembling were adapted from Chapter 6 of the [Machine Learning Engineering Book](http://www.mlebook.com/wiki/doku.php) by Andriy Burkov. If you're looking to enter the field of machine learning engineering, not only building models but production-scale machine learning systems, this book is highly recommended.\n",
